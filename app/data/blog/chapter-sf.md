*a blog for myself and for friends who asked me about the trip*

This would be my attempt to capture everything that I've seen and learned during my 2 week trip in SF.

I was mainly there to attend a program called [Silicon Valley Fellowship](https://www.siliconvalleyfellowship.com/) and [Treehacks](https://www.treehacks.com/), but it ended up being much more than that.

Here are the highlights of the trip:
- missed my flight and ended up meeting a wonderful Tunisian family who hosted me in their house
- Richard Socher ranch visit and talk
- Founders inc last minute visit
- Stanford visit and childhood friend reunion

### Serendipity 
You hear this word thrown around most of the time in SF, but you never really understand it until you stay there for some time.
You probably heard that in order to increase your surface of luck, you need to be in the right place at the right time. But what does SF has to do with this?

Let's say you meet a random person in your hometown and you're tinkering with a few projects on the side, what are the probability that the person is in the tech field or investing in startups (pretty low if not zero), this is definitely not the case in SF, you can hear people passing through in the park talking about evaluations and potential board meetings and that changes your whole perspective on how you're going to meet your next investor.

The beauty of the city is that you don't know you you're going to meet next, while I was attending an event hosted by a Google Deepmind engineer. I was discussing with the person that sat next to me, how we were using ai coding agents at work to their full capacity. Ended up finding out that he attended MIT 12 years ago and was building a fintech startup who just raised series A!


### Speed
People move fast here. That's it.
The incubation of wealth and resources creates this highly curated network of people who have everything in their hands to make it work. 

Your next door neighbor is also building a startup and knows more about OpenClaw then you do. This let people sell, raise and find product market fit faster than any other place on earth. Also the sheer ambitious of the individuals you're surrounded with makes you feel left behind if you're not keeping up with the speed. Most people would say that there's some sort of performance achievement where if you're not building a YC startup, or have raised some kind of big pre or seed investment you're just ngmi (as they say). 

In some sort of way there's a small micro-economy around AI. Founders sell to other founders. Investors throw money at those other founders. Other founders go back and buy from the founders they sell to. Money keeps circulating in a tight loop until something sticks. But isn't that the full point of whole point of building a company? Maybe the whole point is to keep on shipping until you make it big enough to escape the bubble or maybe it's to make something that people want. In the end both of these converge into the same thing.

### The people
This is 



### You can just do things
But I'm not in SF anymore or never have been, what can I do? Should I just wait until I get there to start working?

Shorter answer no. Long answer nooooooooo.(joke)

Long answer is: nooooooooo, just keep shipping. 

In a world where the AI race is real, the only real thing left to assess an individual is agency.
